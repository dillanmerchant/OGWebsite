                           <p style="font-size: 25px;">Dancing is one of Dillan's greatest passions. At a young age, he remembers swaying to the music that his parents 
                              used to play. He started pursuing his passion in sophmore year of high school when he joined the B-boy breakdancing team.
                              In junior and senior year, he used his dance skills to become choreographer and president of a student-run organization 
                              called South Asian Culture Show. <a href="https://southasianculture.wixsite.com/sacs" target="_blank">SACS</a> included close to 150 students from 10 high schools across San Diego and its 
                              primary goal was to raise money for charities in South Asia. The year that Dillan was president, the club raised close to

                           <p style="font-size: 25px;">After casually playing tennis with his dad on weekends, Dillan became interested in this sport in 7th grade. On his first team, he played 
                              #1 singles and won the USTA sectionals. Gaining confidence with this experience, he made the Varisty tennis team in high school 
                              and became assistant coach for On the Rise Tennis Academy. He is still coaching kids in tennis today.

                           <p style="font-size: 25px;">Dillan's love for dogs cultivated after babysitting a friend's maltese. This motivated him to get 
                           involved in a small local rescue called <a href="http://www.hollysgarden.com/" target="_blank">Holly's Garden</a>. For the last few years, his family has fostered many dogs until each dog found 
                           a permanent home. Dillan has helped with fundraising, managing social media, and maintaining the website for Holly's Garden. As he 
                           gains more technical skills from his CS major at UCSD, he hopes to continue finding innovative ways to help dogs in need.</p>
