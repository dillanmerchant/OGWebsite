                                 school when he joined the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">break dancing</span> team. After 2 years of break dancing, he decided to take dance and
                                 combine it with charitable work. He joined the organization <span style="text-decoration: underline;">South Asian Culture Show</span> (SACS) where kids from all
